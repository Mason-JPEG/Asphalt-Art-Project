# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

This project is creating the Armenian Flag. I used 3 different painters. One painter created the white backround, one painter created the flags stripes, and the last painter created the pole. This Flag represents my culture. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

Two things about my project that I am proud of is that I was able to create the code with little to no help and that this project represents my culture making me feel good. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

One thing I would improve or do differently is that I would find a easier way to do my code as its a repeat to create the different lines of stripes.
